# Quantum-Computing_from-basic-to-advanced
I recently went to attend a Physics Research Camp at one of the most renowned institutes in India. I went there with very less expectation of learning much and to be honest, most of the things went over my head. But, the one thing that stuck with me was Quantum Computing and Quantum Mechanics in general. This is my journey of learning Quantum Computing from scratch. 
I will be implementing the learned concepts and their corresponding results in the form of a programming language (Python).    

This repository explores the domain in depth.
